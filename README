HexVexed

A Hexagon game based on DarmWaym's BeVexed, a maddeningly-addictive puzzle game, which was inspired by the Linux game TetraVex.
The concept is simple: put the hexagon tiles in the grid on the left such that the numbers match wherever 2 tiles touch.

About This Version
This is a hexagon based tile puzzle game forked from DarkWyrm's BeVexed code to support 6 sides instead of four.  
The code words but the gameboard isn't yet ready for prime time.
