HexVexed

A Hexagon game based on DarmWaym's BeVexed, a maddeningly-addictive puzzle game, which was inspired by the Linux game TetraVex.

If you've ever heard of a game called TetraVex, you will find this wonderful little time waster all too familiar. The concept is simple: put the hexagon tiles in the grid on the left such that the numbers match wherever 2 tiles touch.
