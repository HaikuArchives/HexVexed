HexVexed

A Hexagon game based on DarKWyrm's BeVexed, a maddeningly-addictive puzzle game, which was inspired by the Linux game TetraVex.
The concept is simple: put the hexagon tiles in the grid on the left such that the numbers match wherever 2 tiles touch.
A variation was added to allow for playing the game with different number bases, such as Binary, Octal and Hexadecimal.

About This Version
This is a hexagon based tile puzzle game forked from DarkWyrm's BeVexed code to support 6 sides instead of four.  
This version is finally stable enough for it's initial release.
